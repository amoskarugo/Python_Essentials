Opening the streams: modes
1. r - open mode: read, file must exist
2. w -  open mode: write - opened in write mode, if file doesn't exist its created 
- if it exists will be truncated to length zero(erased)
-if creation is not possible the open function raises an exception

3. a - open mode: append
- the stream will be opened in append mode;
-the file associated with the stream doesn't need to exist; if it doesn't exist, it will be created; if it exists the virtual recording head
-will be set at the end of the file (the previous content of the file remains untouched).

4. r+ - open mode: read and update
- the stream will be opened in read and update mode;
- the file associated with the stream must exist and has to be writeable, otherwise the open() function raises an exception;
- both read and write operations are allowed for the stream.
5. w+ open mode: write and update

#Reading from a binary file requires the use of a specialized method name readinto(),
#as the method doesn't create a new byte array object, but fills a previously created one with the values taken from the binary file.

Note:

- the method returns the number of successfully read bytes;
- the method tries to fill the whole space available inside its argument; 
if there are more data in the file than space in the argument, the read 
operation will stop before the end of the file; otherwise, the method's 
result may indicate that the byte array has only been filled fragmentarily
(the result will show you that, too, and the part of the array not being used by the newly read contents remains untouched)
